        "Python dictionaries use a hash table implementation for efficient lookups. Immutable keys (like strings, numbers, or tuples containing immutable elements) allow dictionaries to compute and store hash values when the key is inserted. This hash value is used to quickly locate the key's corresponding value during lookups.\n",

        "Immutable keys help prevent key collisions in hash tables. If mutable objects were used as keys and their state changed after insertion into the dictionary, their hash value might change as well.

        "Summary:\n",
        "The immutability of dictionary keys in Python ensures efficient hash table operations, prevents key collisions, and maintains predictable behavior when interacting with dictionary data. By using immutable types as keys (such as strings, numbers, or tuples), you leverage Python's efficient hashing mechanism and ensure the reliability and performance of dictionary operations. This makes dictionaries a powerful tool for fast lookups and data management in Python programming.\n",
